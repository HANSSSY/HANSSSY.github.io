<h2 id="research-background">Research background</h2>
<p align="justify">Nowadays, air pollution caused by many pollutants (such as CO, Pb, NO2, SPM, SO2, and so on) has affected human health greatly, especially the fine particles with diameters less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5)  from SPM. Currently, one of the sustainable ways to solve PM2.5 pollution is through ecosystem services provided by nature, in which air quality regulation service provided by vegetation plays an important role in mitigating air pollution. </p>
<p align="justify">Although people widely know the importance of vegetation to air pollution mitigation, there is still a lack of quantitative methods to quantify this service. Therefore, questions about what's the capacity of air quality service from vegetation and does this capacity from nature can fully offset the PM2.5 emissions released from human activities are still hard to be answered. To solve the above questions, past studies mostly used the dry deposition equation to quantify this service.</p>

<h2 id="required-data-and-methods">Required data and methods</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.itreetools.org/documents/60/iTree_Eco_Dry_Deposition_Model_Descriptions.pdf">Hirabayashi et al. (2012)</a></p>
<p align="justify">**Hirabayashi et al. (2012)** have published detailed descriptions of the dry deposition equation. To practice this equation, the relevant meteorological variables (deposition velocity of PM2.5, PM2.5 concentration, suspension rate, wind speed) and vegetation attributes (spatial distribution, species, leaf area index) need to be collected to calculate the PM2.5 removal rate (g/m2) representing the PM2.5 removal efficiency of the vegetation type. The resolution of data (Years, Seasons, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds) totally depends on your preference and research need. If you still want to know the total PM2.5 removal within your case study, you further need to multiply the total areas of vegetation by the PM2.5 removal rate.</p>

<h2 id="case-study">Case study</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670722002967">Chen et al. (2022)</a><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei">Taipei City</a></p>
<p align="justify">**Chen et al. (2022)** have published a paper to integrate the dry deposition model into a GIS-based workflow to estimate the air quality regulation service provided by urban vegetation, and taking **Taipei City** as a case study (Fig.1 and Fig.2 show the web page and abstract of this article respectively). The results and discussions cover the total PM2.5 removal within a case study and its amounts compared to PM2.5 emissions there, the PM2.5 removal rate of each vegetation type, the corresponding PM2.5 concentration improvement and its spatial match to population distribution, as well as the comparison of the results of Taipei City and that of other cities.</p>
